                        <h2>The Origin</h2>
                        <h3>Pa Syndey Elton-a revolutionary Leader </h3>
                        <p>
                            Sydney Granville Elton popularly called Pa. Elton was born in the year 1928. 
                            He arrived in Nigeria in the year 1937. Growing up in England, 
                            he had the call of God concerning his life and moved to Nigeria as a missionary. 
                            Not looking back he spent the next 50 years of his life doing humanitarian work and even fathering 
                            Pentecostalism in Nigeria even before his demise in the year 1987.

                    <p>
                        Great prophesies were birthed through his life and ministry. He became a mentor and a leader for the likes of Archbishop Benson Idahosa of the Church of God Mission, Apostle Ayodele Babalola, of the Christ Apostolic Church, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye of the Redeemed Church of God, Bishop David Oyedepo of Winners Chapel, Bishop Wale Oke of the Sword of God's Ministry, to name a few.
                       <br><br><br>
                        A few of the legacies of Pa. Elton was his work on university campuses across Nigeria. He was able to shape the next move of God by preparing young men and women on campuses. Great men have been birthed under his tutelage. Pa Elton focused on teaching and exposing Prophetic truths about God's Kingdom and the rise of end-time visionaries who will take the world by storm.
                       <br><br>
                       In one of his prophetic meetings, he prophesied that; "a time will come when the Nigerian government would pay youths to preach the gospel in all the nooks and crannies of the country."
                       <br>
                       This prophecy later came to pass in 1973 as NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) was instituted by the government of General Gowon. NCCF (Nigeria Christian Corpers Fellowship) happens to be the avenue through which this prophecy became a reality. NCCF corpers are known as 'Jesus Corpers'.
                       <br><br>
                       Over the years this prophecy has blossomed and brought forth much fruit from which many have tapped.  Although Pa Elton died on 3rd January 1987, his legacy lives on as a true soldier of Christ and a Father to many.</p>

                        <p>NCCF stands for Nigerian Christian Corpers' Fellowship, established in the year 1983, through our founding father, Pa Elton. 
                            Our establishment came as confirmation of God's prophesy through his servant, Pa Elton. 
                            And since then, this prophesy has been carried on in full expression through Corp members across the 36 states of Nigeria, and the FCT. 
                            As a non-denominational, inter-denominational and nongovernmental organization, we are driven by the burden which we carry as Our Vision:
